We are a joint research lab of the professorship "Learning AI for Dextrous Robots" at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) and the [Institute of Robotics & Mechatronics at Center at the German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/de/rm/forschung/robotersysteme/humanoide/agile-justin).\
Our goal is to create intelligent autonomous humanoid robots that come close to human capabilities, esp. with regard to dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands. We are conducting research in "Autonomously Learning AI", i.e., deep (reinforcement) learning based on first principles and simulation models (no human demonstrations or arbitrary internet videos ...) and the results are zero-shot transferred to the real system.\
[Our program](_pages/research.md) connects basic research in artificial intelligence with highly relevant applications for society, such as industrial manufacturing (given the problem of labor shortage) or service robots as a "helper for the elderly" at home.\
At our lab, we implement our methods on the award-winning mobile humanoid robot [DLR Agile Justin](https://www.dlr.de/de/rm/forschung/robotersysteme/humanoide/agile-justin) with its torque-controlled DLR-Hands II. We also work on commercializing our ai methods and a new generation of a highly dextrous but robust robotic hand.
