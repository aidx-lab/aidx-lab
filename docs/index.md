We are a joint research lab of the professorship "Learning AI for Dextrous Robots" at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Institute of Robotics & Mechatronics at Center at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). 
Our goal is to create intelligent autonomous humanoid robots that come close to human capabilities, esp. with regard to dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands. We are doing research in "Autonomously Learning AI" with a strong focus on modern deep (reinforcement) learning. Our program directly connects basic research in artificial intelligence with highly relevant applications for society, such as industrial manufacturing (given the problem of labor shortage) or service robots as a "helper for the elderly" at home.
At our lab, we work with the award-winning mobile humanoid robot DLR Agile Justin. This advanced platform, coupled with our innovative torque-controlled DLR-Hands II, allows us to conduct cutting-edge research in AI and robotics. We are also excited about our ongoing work on commercializing our AI methods and developing a new generation of highly dextrous but robust robotic hands.
